# CRISPR-BERT
CRISPR-BERT: Enhancing CRISPR/Cas9 off-target activities with mismatches and indels prediction using BERT-based convolutional and recurrent neural networks
## Environment
CUDA is necessary for trainingï¼š
CUDA Version:11.8<br>
<br>
The Python packages should be installed :<br>
* Kera-bert 0.89
* Keras library 2.4.3
* tensorflow-gru 2.5.0
* scikit-learn 0.24.2
## File description
* Encoder.py: You can used this file to encoding sgRNA-DNA sequences and get two coding format of C_RNN needed and BERT needed.<br>
* load_data.py: Used for loading the data from datasets.
* I1.h5: The weight for the CRISPR-BERT model on this dataset.
* model.py: The CRISPR-BERT model with C_RNN and BERT model.
* weight directory: Including BERT weight, if you want to retraining the model, we suggest that you can try different scale of BERT models, you can also load other weight of BERT model in model.py.
## Testing CRISPR-bert
python model_test.py: Run this file to evaluate the CRISPR-BERT model<br>
## Datasets 
Including 7 public datasets:
* I1->CIRCLE_seq_10gRNA_whole
* I2->elevation_6gRNA_wholeDataset
* hek->HEK293t
* k562->K562
* II4
* II5
